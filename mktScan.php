<p>This page will start scanning the market for items associated with LP Stores. Just have an alt sit in Jita, open the page, and hit the start button. It will automatically open the market window to various items in-game. Please be sure that you have an EMDR uploader installed and running, otherwise your data won't go anywhere. EVEMon is an EMDR uploader that most pilots already have installed, just make sure that it's enabled in the settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently only data from The Forge region is being used, so sitting in Dodixie will not benefit <strong>lpStore</strong>.</p>
